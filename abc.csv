"Google is an excellent employer, definitely it's one of the best place to work"
The best 
Google is still great just with the normal frustrations you'd expect for a large company
"A great place to work, but not for entrepreneurs"
"Understand it's a job, not a life, and you'll be fine"
Google - still geat.
Great Temporary Job from Google!
"A different company than probably any you'll work for, but you won't have a life!"
Google could be slipping.
Be wary of joining as a contractor...if that's even an option anymore
"A great company, but by no means perfect."
Great to have on your resume
"Fast pace, flat culture - Loved by many, but NOT by all!"
Google is the place to work in the Tech space and should continue to be if Sr. Management makes some necessary tweaks.
Not as fun as it used to be
not cool to work here anymore
Interesting engineering organization
It deserves it's 
"good place to start a career, not to grow one"
It's okay
"Unbelievable lack of respect for employees at shallow-minded, though smart, company."
Best job I've ever had
Google is a great place to work
"Good experience, don't spend more than a year."
Can be a good and bad place to work
"Great benefits, the people depend on the group"
"Interesting, Challenging, but Cramped"
Great Company!!
"Google, great food, overrated career opportunity"
Great place to work - immersive environment.
Google: A great spring board to bigger and better career opportunities
great people
"Great company to work with, but don't abuse it"
Fantastic place to intern!
2 cents
Great place to work for programmers.
Was a great place to work
"Great perks, but that's about it."
Still a remarkable company
Best place in the world
More and more disappointing
Google is not 'googley' anymore.
A dream employer
Honeymoon period gets over in first two years.
"cool products, fun culture, no long-term career path"
Still THE best place to work
good place to be if you can commit to a lot of hours
"Great first job for software engineers, frustrating for more senior ones."
"Great perks, great projects, great food, long hours if you're not careful."
You can work your 80 hours a week whenever you want.
MBA + no experience = better than no MBA and lots of experience.
Great place to work!
Great Place to work
"Great place to work, but it has its problems"
"Still a fantastic place to work, especially for new graduates."
everything they say and more
"Great Company, Can learn and grow as much as you like"
nice place to work at
Nice place to work after 5/10 years
Good company to work for
"Google is fun, quirky, smart, cool, inspiring. But it can still just be a job."
Google - world's #1 springboard but ultimately not a nice place to grow old
Google is Great
As good as I thought it would be
As good as a large company gets
There is such a thing as a free lunch after all.
"Still a good company, but may not be the best anymore"
Great place to start your career
"come for the perks, stay for the challenge"
Best company I've worked at that hasn't gone under.
stock options underwater
"Good place, could be better"
Engineer
Google is actually as good as advertised.
"Google, from inside the tank"
Google is deteriorating at the edges
Google is a great place to work.
change recruiting
It's really big nowadays... but still the place to be if you wan't to challenge yourself on really hard problems.
"If you get an offer, take it."
Google is fun and they will hire you if your parents were rich and sent you to an elite college.
I loved it at Google!
Time to leave for my own startup?
Great company to work at
Unfortunately Google is less and less a cool place for senior software engineers
It's good to be a Googler!
Best job ever
Google is a great environment for software engineers
great place to work
Try to spend a least 2 years at Google - it will really change your ability to move around the industry afterwards.
Google - is the top search result for the best job!! Definitely feeling lucky!
"Awesome perks and work environment, frustrations around career path"
"All in all, still a great place to work"
Work at Google and Change the World.
Google is probably the best place to work there is.
"Higher total compensation than competitors, engineering-dominated company, and incredibly bright coworkers."
Google Rocks!
"Optimistic, but realistic. Satisfied."
Happiest place I've ever worked
Geek Paradise
Great company for self guided individuals
A Great Company Rarely Seen
Lots of interesting problems and chances to grow if you work at it.
"Great place to learn and meet people, but not the place to stay in longer terms."
"Great for world-shattering innovators, could be better for other indispensable employee roles"
As great as you think
The best company to work for
Mmm. Tasty desserts.
Great company! (although there are risks on the horizon)
Google - dream job for the right kinds of engineers
Great just isn't good enough.
Good
kicks ass
Still the best experience of my life
Still one of the best places to work at.
"Great place, but declining morale an issue"
"Good benefits, but a lot of things could be improved."
Google--not quite the golden palace it's perceived to be
Google is a nice place to work
the best company to work for in the world
Google: Don't be evil.
"Google is still a great place to work, flaws and all"
"Great place to work, but it is still just a company"
"Great engineers, mediocre managers."
There is a reason why Google is rated the top place to work
Great place to work
Google is cool but over rated!
"Google is still a great company, but could work on more individual employee attention."
Great place to work
"Fun On the Outside, Many Problems Internally"
"Great place to work, great resume builder"
"Great place to work, but Google could do a better job handling employees from companies it acquires"
Worth the trouble.
Great Company with Some Growing Pains
Google's hiring bar is off the mark
Who's in charge?
arrogance in the air ....
Brilliant but I wish he really knew what was going on below him.
Google: A New Kind of Employer for A New Century
"It's like Jonestown, except without the delicious beverage"
"Great experience, but not a perfect workplace"
"Not quite paradise, but not bad either."
Sacrifice your life to Google
"Not perfect, but better than most"
a great place to work if you're self-directed and highly motivated
"Great, but slowly gravitating toward just good."
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
"Google, there will never be another company like it in our Lifetime"
Amazing experience - yes Google is that cool!!!
"Perspective from a middle of the pack, both in terms of job level and employee count"
Great
"Great place to work, but challenging leadership problems at scale."
Google is probably the best big company to work for.
Feeling Lucky? You are if you work Google.
"Google, not what you think, at least not any more....."
It's not what it's cracked up to be.
Best geek place to work...period...
"Beyond the fantasy, Google is still corporate."
Google is a great place to work if you are competent enough.
"Awesome culture, bad management"
"If you can live up to the challenge, its the best place to be. Think twice if you're female, or have family."
"Fun at first, frustrating in the long run."
Google is still a fantastic place to work.
Google:An Elitist's Playground
Great place to work with wonderful benefits but paychecks should be bigger
Get back to basics.
Lving it but wish I had a real office
Google is a great place to work as an engineer - just don't expect a small company environment
:-)
"Amazing company culture, products, technology, and employee benefits."
Don't work at Google unless you want to corporate climb to nowhere.
Googlicious
Entrepreneur at Google
"Nice place to work, but so are a lot of other places."
Google PM
"An open, collaborative, innovative and flexible place to work."
"Great people to work with, fun environment."
Perks are fantastic but work is overwhelming and directionless.
Working for Google there is always a massive amount of opportunity to learn.
Google is such a great place to work.
"Very open communication compared to other employers, self-directed, company empowers people."
It is a job I enjoy very much.
It is exciting and rewarding job.
Dynamic place to work due to diverse cultures.
Very laid-back and flexible environment. Challenging at times.
One of the best jobs of my life because I work with such great people.
Work with smart people who are willing to share information.
"An open and collaborative environment, highly innovative."
Working for Google has been exciting over the last few years but is growing less so over time.
Freedom within the company and lots of things to do & learn.

Great place to work but...
"Fast paced, agressive, innovative culture but hard to balance family & career"
Great place to work...if you can handle it and have the right personality
Amazon is too distracted
Great if you like warehousing work
Stay away!
It was an up and down ride.
Good place to work if you land in the right workgroup. Limited ability to advance w/o leaving and coming back.
It's a grind
You will be Jack of all. Master of none. I would never work again here.
"Back breaking work with penalties for taking a break for restroom or to rest legs arms, back etc."
"Learned a lot from smart people, but really depends on the team you are in"

Very short term and a sweat shop
A rollercoaster ride that is full of chaos and firefighting.
Chaotic and disorganized work environment
Fast agile place for workaholics
It is what you make it - lots of opportunity
Misleading and Stale
An amoral company whose employees have no work-life balance
Great place to work .. if you are entrepreneurial but want the comfort of a big-company
Strong technical growth opportunities
"The people are great, but the work life balance is terrible."
Unfortunately the company does not invest in their employees and leadership is not positive.
Internship program is very competitive in terms of keeping interns at the company for full time positions
Enjoyable place to work
"Unfortunately, the highest pay in this area."
"High potential to be a great place to work, but..."
Awesome place to work
Loose Federation of Small Interdependent Teams Working on Diverse Projects
Area Manager Review
its a job but know what you are getting into before you fall for all the smoke and mirrors
"Broken Promises, Lack of Respect, Only Good for a Steady Paycheck"
It's a sweatshop
Good Ride
"Amazon is a great company and global brand. Working here has its downsides, but I'm quite satisfied overall."
A hard place to work
Not a Long Term Career
"Decent place to work, but more needs to be done....."
I would strongly advice against this place
"Cool technology, ambitious goals."
"Customer focused, get it done culture"
It's Not A New Age Fairy Tale
"Decent pace, horrible management"
its a tough road but you will learn a lot
"It was extremely hard to meet their performance quotas, nearly impossible."
"Video On Demand, a horrible experience"
Working at Amazon is great!
Worst Place to Work Ever!!!
Not So Glamorous
Growing..bumps along the way
Great opportunity if you're hardworking
"Amazon does a lot right, but their ego is one thing that trips them up often"
Needs less ex-military and more business professionals
What you'd expect
Great company
no respect
Area Manager Review
Jeff Bezos is a genius and a visionary
"Single, looking for soul-mate (Corporate)"
Good place to work if you do not mind the operational burden
lots of potential

Unhealthy Culture in Distribution Centers
"Great company to work for, the sales department is horrible"
"If you decide to work here, ask in the interview what Top Grading is, and what its counterpart is."
amazon is a great employer to work for!
Continues to get worse
intern
It's like a pirate ship.
good company
Stay away from this place--toxic as hell
Churn and burn

Great place to work if you are willing to work hard!
Experience depends on your manager
No work / life balance
Avoid Amazon at all costs

Good place to work
Expect to work hard

Great place to work and develop your career
Marketing Manager

horrible experience (stay away from retail!)
Great place for a new college grad - some teams better than others

Depends on where you land
I'm enjoying it
Interning at Amazon.com
If you want to be a number and work with the worst Senior Leadership Team then come work here.

Be Prepared To Do Your Worst Work!
Not for everyone. Mostly A-type personalities preferred.
"Good for customers, Bad for employers"
"Learn on the job, fast-pace, always changes, reactive"
Amazon is a meat grinder that chews people up and spits them out - avoid avoid.
Opportunities are there if you're interested.
A place to grow as a developer
pretty decent. nothing exceptiponal
Depends on what kind of manager you get...
AMZn is place to be..
"Choatic, Hectic, Cutting Edge, Smart Corporation"
"Amazon is a good place to get started, but once you have experience move on."
Great Place to Learn
â??Great place to workâ?
Don't work here. Most difficult year of my life. During this time I had to go on a 1/2 dozen medications just to cope.
good
Depends on who is leading your team
Solid Job
Great company. Makes you get out of your confort zone! Jeff Bezo is great
hit or miss
We are not a company that prides itself in work/life balance
OVerall good company
"Nice place to work, but an odd culture."
pros and cons
Amazon.com provides tough challenges and safe employment
Not a good place to work
if you can work here you can work anywhere
Terribly busy place to work
Great place to work
Some places at Amazon are really good... and some aren't

Fist 2 years.. not so good
"Amazon.com, Worth 2 years of your life but not much more"

"A strenuous interview process, but the company is filled with top notch people and it was a GREAT experience."
Not an engineering-oriented company
Amazon Interview briefer.
Realistic Amazonian
"A solid company run by competent people, but I wouldn't recommend to others"
Amazon is a great place to work
Small company atmosphere with big company stability
Amazon: The big company that thinks it's a little company
Truly dedicated to the Customer.
"Very interesting company, not a great place to work."
Continual chaos and turf wars - but nice view of the harbor.
Great place to learn
"A confusing, stressful job for young people before they go somewhere with real career prospects."
"Way to go, Amazon."
"Much promise, dismal reality"
Good career experience but there are companies that treat employees better
Fascinating high tech environment
Great people
Best job I have ever had!
Work hard and smart.
Worst. Job. Ever.
good company to work for in 2009
Good place to work for awhile - but come with strong will and tenacity
Petty resentments thrive within management at Amazon.
Simply great company to work for
Resume and skill set builder

A legend in its own mind

"Great coworkers, but subpar pay and recognition."
A great place to work if you are in a software development role
Great company.

Amazon.com a good place to work
Great place to work
Good place for the initial years
Amazon the super-positive!

N/A
A great place to learn online business
"Big name for the resume, but tough environment"
"Come here to work hard, have no social life, get treated unfaily by management BUT have a bigger bank balance"
Amazon - a mixed bag
Why does it feel so bad to be so empowered?
Would it hurt to try and make Amazon earth most employee centric company as well.
An interesting place to work... for a while.
Amazon is a great place to make a difference
Go Amazon
Hard work will pay off.
Amazon started me off on the right track
A factory job for software developers. Tops down management at its best.
Grey like the weather
Great place for software engineering
Work-Life balance = 0
Great tech company with limited bureaucracy.
Poor employee retention
"Lots of smart people, a bit of a meat grinder"
"Great place to learn, Some teams are better than others, Incompetence exists just like any other big company."
Amazon great company lots of challenges
In this market...its a job.
Top company to work for in Tech Industry
Amazon is all about the people!
Amazon.com: Hard work and high visibility
"Amazon - Smart people, innovating quickly to create a better customer experience."
Warehouse Associate
It's not for everyone to work here.
Not your small startup anymore.
Fast paced environment
"Lots of smart engineers and groups, but be careful of poorly run oncall rotations"
"-Just started, but already noticing trends"
"Amazon, interesting work, long hours"
A learning experience...a stepping stone for success elsewhere.
Great place to start but wouldn't stay long-term
Great company to work for if that's all you want to do.
Encourages 
Great learning environment. Tough culture for advancement.
Long timer's perspective.
"Great for customers, bad for employees"
"A great company to learn, good opportunities for different roles, but prepare to fast and challenging work"
End the good ol' boys club at the S-Team level

The best job I've ever had.
Mixed bag
"Customer comes first, employees are last"
"Great customer experience, but can be stressful to work."
"Work is challenging , but i dont think i am rewared for the amount of effort i put in"
Amazon says: 
A lot of experience and a lot of work
Poor engineering makes Amazon.com a training experience for a better job elsewhere.
How much do you devalue yourself?
Product Manager Review
Overall good company to work for
"Could be great, but management treats employees like crap"
Fortune 500 .com
Amazon.com is an average place to work
"Good place to learn, must have thick skin to stay long-term"
"A great place to bootstrap your engineering career, but don't stay too long"
work here for few years to get experience
Creativity in the midst of chaos
Great place to get your career started
amazon.com slow and steady
"Hire the best, and then empower them to make the company great"
Know what you're getting into
Good long-term approach and great focus on customer
There are worse places tro work
"Great Experience (Amazon years = Dog years), Superb Colleagues, Plenty to Improve"
Happy working there
Burnout is likely
Great company
Stifling Micromanagement
Worst company in Seattle
"Very intelligent, but also very idiosyncratic."
pretty good place to work
"Micromanagement will drive you crazy, but opportunities are there."
Hard work pays off
not for everyone
This place is still being run the same way it was when it started (with some minor improvements)
Challenging and fun place to work
Are you part of the 8%?
You can learn a lot but say goodbye to your free time
"Great pay, low benefits, great environment"
"Great place to work, slackers need not apply"
"love to be shareholder, but not employee"
"Amazon, great place to work for a huge jump start on a great career."
"Still new in amazon, so far so good"
Great Place to have worked
Think like an owner!
Decent place to work if all you want to do is work.
Great place to work if you are creative and also execute on you ideas. Mere visionaries will find it hard.
good experience
"Good company, but low morale at the FCs"
Sweatshop
"Join if you need some experience, but stay away if you are looking for a promotion."
A great place to work if you can get through the initial fire drills
Amazon
great place to work!
"Amazon - Lovely to visit, poor to stay"
"Amazon.com- work hard, no time for a life."
Good place to cut your teeth and learn where you want to go next.
Intelligence demanded. Leadership neither expected nor given.
Great place to work.
A good place to cut your teeth!
"Great brand, great stock, poor professional growth."
Burn and churn isn't good!
Excellent place to work with great starting pay with slightly too much demand for your personal time.
It's fun if you make it fun
The company is decent
"Very good place to work, if you are willing to commit yourself"
Challenging environment with a multitude of opportunities.
Burnout is the order of the day!
"You'll work longer, harder & smarter than elsewhere - and then you'll burn out."
"Exciting challenges in scale and availability to solve, but benefits could be better"
"Driven Amazonians find time for fun, feedback can be lacking"
"You will do some great work, then burn out."
Startup or Corporate? Maybe both.
Could be better could be worse
Overall Great Company to Work For
"Amazon.com, it's not fun, you won't remember it fondly, but you may learn a few things and make a few bucks."
Amazon is the best customer centric company
I wouldn't do it again.
"Perfect fit for people who like to build, test and maintain their code."
Fun start-up turned toxic
"you will do shxt work most of the time, think of the job for an operator in a laundry room"
"Chaotic, but a rigorous and valuable learning experience"
Amazon is an amazing place to work at.
"Challenging, engaging work with a lot of freedom - but beware the pager"
"Work hard, learn, leave..."
Great place for the right person.
Opportunity with responsibility
"Amazon - have fun, work hard, make history"
"Great place to work and make history, but doesn't leave that much time for fun."
Still an exciting place to work (provided you are on the right team)
Great company to work for but also depends on the groups you will join
Great for the resume if your psyche can handle it.
A great place to learn how business and technology work together.
Pockets of incompetent Directors and VPs. Practice politics to survive.
Amazon is a great stepping stone for the young and unencumbered.
Know what environment you perform best in - then see if Amazon's culture is a good fit
Love the good with the not so good
Decentralization means autonomy... but also chaos.
Dynamic environment with smart people who know they are smart.
"Be owner, make the history."
Not a place to stay long-term
"challenging, hard-work, operations-heavy"
Interesting place for a short stint
"Challenging work environment, not for the faint of heart"
"I'm grateful and I learned a ton, but it wasn't a lot of fun at the time."
Challenging environment with great rewards!
I love working for Amazon.com!!!!
If you have nothing else to do in life this is a great place for you to be awake all the time...
I love working at Amazon.
"Good corporate values, still small enough to retain that entrepreneurial spirit, but watch out for the pager"
Great company to work for
"Great, innovative company with smart, fun people. Work Hard. Play Hard. Have Fun."
"It has made me hate the world, and human race as a whole. 2 years later, I'm still trying to undo the damage."
"Great people, good company, incomprehensible compensation model"
none
Amazon is among the greatest large-company employers on the planet.
Amazon.com is a really fun and exciting place to work
"Great place to learn, awful managers."
"Great place to gain experience, cash in on it when you leave."
Thumbs up for Amazon
"Great company for customers and shareholders, but only so-so for engineers"
Reasonably satisfied engineer
Recommend Against Working There
Are they really paying me this much?
Amazon is Secretive and Cheap
Although frustrating at times it's still a vibrant place to work
Great place to work as long as you like to work hard
"Satisfied SDEII says you'll learn alot, some of it will be applicable elsewhere."
Amazon opportunities vs. poor follow through
I love what I do and am glad I get to do it Amazon.
Disappointed
Amazon - where you want to be!
"Can be a great place to work, depending on what team you're on."
Passionate people makes everything easy
Fairly Satisfying Position
Great place to work for and lots of talent to learn from...
Stimulating place to work -- helps to be thick-skinned
"Great place for coders, long work hours, little appreciation"
An amazingly rewarding but very challenging place to work.
Demanding and Intense
Amazon.com A Innovative Company
"Great place, lots of talent to work with and learn -- if you have NO personal life"
Legacy code green-card sweatshop from hell
"ok,,"
Stop calling being cheap frugal
Stop burning out your employees
"You'll always be challenged and empowered at Amazon, but make sure you take your career growth in your own hands."
Totally worth the experience
Amazon and Innovation
"Great place to learn, schedule is a strain."
"Great place, great pay, HARD work, fun atmosphere"
amazon.com is a fantastic place to work
Don't think that Amazon is a place to advance your career.
Amazon.com and you're done.
Work life balance is not part of working at Amazon.com
Ultimately it's a job.
"If you love spending the majority of your waking time working, this is the place for you"
"Like working at Wal-Mart, except you write software"
Not. Getting. Better.
Not a great place to work but not bad either
Great experience for n00bs.
Love it!
Amazing
Easy come easy go.
Rating for the Employee Experience: Improvement Needed
The only place where senior managers who cause 100% attrition five times over can still get $2 million bonuses.
"An okay place to work, has it's issues, but also has its positives."
"Amazon.com: you will learn a lot, but you will probably end up hating your job."
fantastic projects and people vs. top down micro-management...
Amazon a hard working and performance based rewards company
Challenging work environment
It's a love/hate relationship
Amazing Amazonians
Amazon = ok.
You learn a lot but not a place you want to stick around more than 2 years if you want a life!
You don't realize what you gotten into...
"Working at Amazon is a crapshoot, it all depends on which team you join (most suck though!)"
"High Salary, Hard working"
Welcome to the Matrix
Amazon.com - beware!
Replacing you is cheaper than paying you more
Office Space
Amazon.com - a challenging environment where the sky is the limit
"Decent for a first job out of college, but don't stay too long."
SO WHAT'S UP WITH PERSONEL AT AMAZON
Make sure to look behind the curtain. This place ain't Oz.
A review of Amazon
Great place for interns to start their careers.
I can't believe I get paid to do what I love!
About what you'd expect when you sell your soul. You get a good price for it though.
"A fair website, but sucks as a place to work"
"Amazon isn't all it's cracked up to be, unless you're an engineer you probably won't be happy"
Pay raise? You get stock!
Long hours and low pay.

The best design culture I have ever been in.
"High pace, low direction"
Best place I have ever worked
"Decent pay, good feedback from supervisors"
Great Company
Really great place to work!
"Salary 15% above market , Duration of employment 90% below market, Worst culture to work in"
"Work hard, be innovative, and always be prepared"
"Careful: If you happen to be fired for any reason, it is broadcast to everyone you worked with!"
"Smart People, fast moving"
The cracks start to show pretty quickly.
"Terrible. They bring you on as a temp, and withhold health benefits for up to a year."
Working for the Nazis.
Revolving Door
Worst Place I have ever worked
Started off great and degraded from a very positive culture to your typical production line call center.
Absolutely terrible and soul-crushing
Challenging but worthwhile.
"Can be fun, can be awful"
"Powerful brand, unpleasant place to work"
Pays well for a temp job
The marketing and PR team is lost
Great Place to Work!
"Opportunity for advancement and success if you get lucky, otherwise it's just a metter of time."
Used to be much better! Wait for some senior management changes before you consider.
"Revisiting my review after working here for a while. There are better, rewarding careers out there."
"used to be a great place, but every year things get taken away, like paid vacation/holidays."
Overall great place to work.
Uncomfortable environment with lackluster management
Great place to work if you're looking for brilliant people who think outside of box about absolutely everything.
Great place to work so far
Don't waste your time if you live in the Bay Area! There are better places to dedicate your time!
"Quit, before you're fired."
Networking + Not Screwing Up = Another Paycheck
It's a lot like if 
Come join us!
Great place...if you want to kill your career!
"It was absolutely awesome, until I was let go."
"One of the best run companies, great benefits, no sick leave or vacation policy & exceptional pay"
"An okay place to work, for a short term job."
Neurotic and unforgiving
Hell with free Easy Mac
"This place is absolutely grueling, they eat you up and spit you out."
"It paid decent, but the level of efficiency stripped all the human aspects away."
"My advice - accept job here, get kicked out after half year"
If Netflix was a TV show: Action Series with a Hint of Survivor
"Work was going well, but I was fired for being sick"
The Right Place If You Are The Right Fit
Best run company I have ever been with and I have been with some good orgs.
Times are tough so you probably need the job but start looking for a career ASAP once hired!
Don't make the mistake of working here
High performance with high forced attrition
Crippled Culture
people are expendable
Phenom place to work if you are lucky enought to be offerred a position
"Netflix as a service is great, but I don't recommend them as an employer, at least, not at the Hillsboro call center."
Highly Talented Group of Employees
Stay Away. You do not want to work here.
"Netflix: A company that doesn't value employees, but only sees them as a means to an end."
Stressful is an understatement
Must drink the KoolAid
"company attitude: we pay you well and can kick you out at any moment , you shut up and put up with our rubbish"
Management is asleep at the wheel
Good Management Team and Bright Employees
Best Call Center to work for by far...
They suck you in and then kick you out

Three works can summarize the culture at Netflix. : Culture of Fear.
Great place to work
Fear-based culture
Take What You Can Get
"Smart People, Poor Management"
Total Lack Of Respect For Employees
"Good for the short run, high turnover, long hours, don't get too comfortable"
Decent Place to work
The Truth About the Netflix Call Center..... :(
Worst treatment of humans I have ever seen.
Netflix: Culture of Fear
"Great place to work, but if you are looking for an easy secure job, Netflix is not for you."
Call center job
Great place for highly motivated super-stars
hit or miss
Do Yourself a Favor and Don't Apply Here
Employees treated like a paper towel - good for one use then throw away.
Worst place to work.
"Good pay, terrible communication between management and employees"
"Love the company, Hate working for it!"
Good Developers but bad Company Culture
Most of the negative reviews on this site are accurate.
Great place if you can handle the pressure.
Good if the job suites you
"I loved my co-workers, but spent a year fearing my management."

"It's an OK stepping stone, but get out when you can."
IT Operations upheaval
A successful cult
It is a great place to learn while you earn
"Well ran company, better call center"
Great Place to work-Never had a problem
The number one priority for Management is recruiting (huh?)
Hillsboro Call Center in Constant State of Flux
Keep up the good work
"Rave, gush, yell from the rooftops (for the right people)"
"Pay was great, leadership was horrendous.."
It's ok
High performance company that does what it says it does
"OK place to work, not worth all the stress"
Bummer
Great place if you are a great employee
Not worth the stress! Everyone hates their job there!
Tough to meet expectations
"So much potential to be a great place to work, too bad it's not."
"Great company, no growth"
"Great at first, then reality hit."
If you are dedicated to working hard and striving for excellence Netflix may be for you!
They hire you and then fire you
"Lots of Work, Lots of Turn Over"
Dynamic with High Expectations
Great Place to Work
Middle management is arrogant and incompetent
Be prepared to sell your soul...
A workplace where top performance is rewarded with opportunities for advancement.
"Tunnel vision of being the best, not peering out to view the rest."
Great place to work so far after a few months.
Be ready for the ride of your life!
"It's a job, but only just that."
Not Worth It
"Disorganized chaos, insanely high turnover."
Employee Beware..Working for Netflix in Hillsboro Call Center.
Never regretted working there but definitely got out at the right time.
Just Shocking
Wrong perception about what they are and what they can do
Netflix hires the best and brightest but realize that you are hired for one job and vertical movement is unlikely.
Don't think your going to be taking some long vacations and slacking off friends!
lovin it
Netflix
"Like a good drama: A flashy young company in a nice setting, but with lots of tension under the surface"
"Great CEO, a lot to learn there, but some cultural flaws. Worth working for."
The most satisfying place to be a rockstar contributor in Silicon Valley. Not a place for anyone else.
Netflix is true to their advertised culture of freedom & responsibility.
"Strong company for self- starters, Call Center needs work"
"great company, limited career opportunities"
Add Netflix to your job searching queue
DO NOT WORK FOR NETFLIX
"Working at Netflix can be good, but....."
"Netflix is a great place to work for a couple of years and get on your resume, then leave for the next opportunity"
"good company, competitive work environment"
"If you are lucky enough to get an offer from Netflix, take it."
There's good and bad...just like anywhere else.
"great challenges, limited growth"
Earn big bucks and get fired
Great for a couple of years
Great for movie lovers without families
"Get in, get experience, get out."
I work for a company that changed the way Americans rent movies.
"Great for people, good for career."
Teamwork is central to the culture.
"Not perfect, but definitely two-thumbs up!!"
Reed between the lines.
Netflix: What if an entire company did a Chinese fire drill?
Great place to grow your career
"Good in the short term, but ..."
"be wary of the operations side of the business, much different approach than IT and Corp"
A career at Netflix can be rewarding if your coworkers are competent and have a modicum of social skills.
An extraordinary environment creates an exciting work experience.
Netflix is a great place to work with an extraordinary group of people
High Performance Culture & Extraordinarily Talented People
Love what you do
"A killer combo: great business, the best people and a fantastic work environment"
Great place to work!
"Netflix! The good, the bad and the ugly!"
Great place to work for risk-taking high performers.
Really great place to work (if it's a culture fit)
"Netflix is an amazing, high performance place to work"
Great place to work in good times and bad.
"An amazing company to work with, very focussed, leader in dvd rentals and interet media."
Awesome
Great company
Enjoy risk taking? This is or isn't the company for you!
Honestly well-run business
Netflix builds careers and character.
"Great company, inspiring people."
"Reed is a strong leader with a vision, and has gathered great people to help him make the vision real."
Best company I have worked for in my 25 year career.
Netflix is a great place for star performers to shine
"Netflix is a great place for hard working, talented people."
this is a great company that could benefit from treating its talent better
"A leader who never, never takes his eye off the ball."
Netflix is-a company that truly encourages innovative thinking and risk taking.
"good, not great"
Cold-hearted place. you'll have a job in the morning but by mid-day you might not have a job
A straighforward company who knows who they are and are not.

Question everything and deliver world-class service.
"All in all, a great place to work"
Netflix is Great! ...Just Stay Out of the Call Center.
I wish I would've joined years ago.
"Netflix is a great company, the Oregon office is tumultuous."
Great place to work
"If you get the chance, work there"
Netflix deserves its status as a top tier company.
great place to work
I love it.
Love it.
"High performance culture, freedom and responsibility within"
"A great, fun place to work"
The job is full of freedom and responsibility.

"Fantastic place to work, but don't put your phone down"
I would probably still be at Netlfix if I hadn't returned to school
Work here if job security is not important to you.
They will ride you until your wheels fall off.
"Highly aligned teams, excellent talent, driven by data"
It is a OK place to work.
Lost their way
"For Hub Manager -Great Pay, but zero job security or training, or stability."
Good company - Great people
good summer job if you are willing to work early in the morning doing mind-numbing work
The pit of Hell
Find a better place
I liked the daily feedback of performance.
"Some good, some bad"
Great place to work if you have the right boss...I have a great boss so it is the best place I have ever worked
Netflix lets people go for very questionable reasons. VERY high turnover...unlike I have ever seen before
Great pay but don't know how to treat employees
Be cautious about accepting a job here. Extremely high dismissal rate.
"Good place, smart people, great company...some serious issues though"
"Stay, far, far away from here.."
Get on the ride.
Pretty Good.

Netflix..........Great people & great opportunities
The pay is the top of the market
i don't work there anymore
"Looks good on paper, questionable execution..."
no rules until there are rules
how on earth?!
"Great place to work, until you speak your mind."
"Start at 2:30 AM, work 60-80 hours a week, die a slow, painful death..."
Like two different companies between Web and Ops
Great Place to Work

Microsoft has grown too big and the management team has lack the knowledge to listen and ignores feedback.

Great place to work but focused a little too much internally
This is the best company I've worked for in my 6 year career.

"Overall good, however, it depends on group"
Good career path
A stable company but still is not for lazy people
A: Who do you work for? Me: Microsoft A: I guess somebody has to!
Mixed - depends on the group
if you can work 10-12 hours everyday on regular basis - you can grow easily. Forget work-life balance!!
Not the cult it used to be - far more a job now
Having fun at Microsoft
a good learning place
Microsoft Services is bad.
I started off great some years ago but lately company is running out of steam
Good company.
Enriching experience for a beginner but bad for long term growth
